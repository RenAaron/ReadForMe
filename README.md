Optical character recognition &amp; text to speech application for reading text aloud on one's monitor. 

This application is still in development.

You must have Tesseract installed and change the path variable accordingly to it's location on your device.  

Pressa '`' to start highlighting over an area and hover over the area you would like to select. 
All highlights must be started from the top left and end at the bottom right. (yes I will fix this in the future)
